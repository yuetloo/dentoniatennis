# How to Live Stream to Youtube Live Continuously

## Using bat and task scheduler
ðŸŽ¬ How it works:
*	Streams your webcam to YouTube using FFmpeg
*	Automatically restarts if FFmpeg fails or exits
*	Includes a short 5-second delay between retries

â¸»

âœ… Instructions

ðŸ”§ Step 1: Download ffmpeg

```
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

# on windows
winget install ffmpeg
```


2. Open start-stream.bat, and replace:
*	USB2.0 Camera with your actual webcam device name
*	Microphone (Realtek Audio) with your actual microphone device name
*	YOUR_STREAM_KEY with your YouTube stream key

```
# Identify your webcam on Windows
ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy
```

```
# Look for webcam name under*
DirectShow video devices
```
3. Save start-stream.bat as `C:\ffmpeg-stream\start_stream.bat`

â¸»

ðŸ“Œ Notes:
*	This will keep retrying forever if FFmpeg fails.
*	Make sure ffmpeg.exe is in your system PATH or use its full path in the command:

"C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe" -f dshow -i ...
